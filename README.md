## Debloating a Realme X50 5G (UK version)

The Realme X50 5G is an Android phone which means it's got a ton of junk stashed away on it that bloating it up that you just don't need.

So let's get rid of it shall we.

In this repo there are two text files detailing what you need to know. All of this is done at your own risk, I take no responsibility if you delete something you shouldn't have, but everything documented here I have removed from my own X50 5G without any issues.

It should also be said that this is on the UK version of the phone, not all of the junk will be installed on all of the phones, likewise the UK version won't have a bunch of things that you'll find elsewhere in the world (theme store comes to mind.)

It's a fairly conservative list for now, I'm still researching what else could be thrown in the bin. Will update as I learn more.

I've also now added a batch file for one click removal of all the packages on my list. Download and run it if you want the full list, if not, edit the file in a text editor first and remove the parts you want to keep on your phone. I haven't actually tested the batch file yet, so for now it's definitely used at your own risk.
