## Debloating a Realme X50 5G (UK version)

The Realme X50 5G is an Android phone which means it's got a ton of junk stashed away on it that bloating it up that you just don't need.

So let's get rid of it shall we.

In this repo there are (will be) two text files detailing what you need to know. All of this is done at your own risk, I take no responsibility if you delete something you shouldn't have, but everything documented here I have removed from my own X50 5G without any issues.

It should also be said that this is on the UK version of the phone, not all of the junk will be installed on all of the phones, likewise the UK version won't have a bunch of things that you'll find elsewhere in the world (theme store comes to mind.)

It's a fairly conservative list for now, I'm still researching what else could be thrown in the bin.
