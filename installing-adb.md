## Installing and using ADB

I'm not going to write out all the steps necessary to use ADB on your machine, there are plenty of guides out there on how to get it all set up properly (I've linked some below).

Instead I'm going to point you to the best place to get the tools you need for Windows, Mac or Linux, and how to make sure your phone is set up right to interact with ADB.
